### A Merge Sort works as follows:
* Takes an array and splits it up into sets of 2
* Compares the 2 and puts the smallest in front of the larger.
* Next, as we go down. We compare the first of the left with the first of the right and move the smaller one down. Then check the remaining one on the left with the others on the right. Repeat for the next set.
* We do the same as the last step with these 2 last lists until we end up with 1 sorted list.

### Pseudocode Example:
```

### This is a very common sorting algorithm and can be implemented in pretty much every language.<br>Check out the rest of this folder to see some examples of it at work!
